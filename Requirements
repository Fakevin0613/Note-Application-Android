Usability, Maintainability, Performace, Recoverability

Usability: The interface is clean and tidy. Most users can understand the interface and UI at the first glance. (This would be tested by asking volunteers to use the app)

Maintainability: High cohesion and low coupling.

Recoverability: Cloud back-up

Performance: Stable(No crashing) and smooth(low response time).
